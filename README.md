# MediTrack360
MediTrack360 is a production-style data engineering project that simulates a hospital analytics platform. It uses Terraform, Docker, Airflow, Spark, S3, and Redshift to build an end-to-end data pipeline with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, enabling operational dashboards and KPI reporting for hospital management.

## The system addresses challenges such as:

Long patient waiting times

Bed shortages

Medicine stockouts

Disconnected systems

Manual reporting inefficiencies

## Technology Stack

Infrastructure: Terraform, Docker

Databases: PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift

Streaming & Orchestration: Kafka, Apache Airflow

Storage: Amazon S3 (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)

Processing: PySpark

Data Quality: Great Expectations

Visualization: Power BI

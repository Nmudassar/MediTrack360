# MediTrack360
MediTrack360 is a production-style data engineering project that simulates a hospital analytics platform. It uses Terraform, Docker, Airflow, Spark, S3, and Redshift to build an end-to-end data pipeline with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, enabling operational dashboards and KPI reporting for hospital management.

## The system addresses challenges such as:

Long patient waiting times

Bed shortages

Medicine stockouts

Disconnected systems

Manual reporting inefficiencies

## Technology Stack
